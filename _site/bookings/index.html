		Breakfast is included in the price if you are staying in one of the bedrooms within Pump Cottage. Breakfast is not included when staying at Pump View. However, there are coffee and tea making facilities in the studio, including an electric kettle and mini fridge. Pump Lodge is a self-catered holiday let, therefore breakfast is not provided.</p>

		<p><strong>When can I check-in / check-out of the property?</strong><br>
		You can check-in any time between 4pm and 7pm. Please check-out before 10am.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your policy regarding pets?</strong><br>
		Unfortunately, pets are not accepted at Pump Cottage, Pump Lodge, or Pump View.</p>

		Children of all ages are welcome to stay at Pump Lodge. However we are only able to offer accommodation for children aged 12 and above in Pump Cottage and Pump View.</p>

		If paying by cheque, please make out all payments to Mrs Sue Moore.</p>

		<p><strong>What is your cancellation policy?</strong><br>
		We operate a moderate cancellation policy, which means that guests will receive a 50% refund of the total cost (minus the booking fee ) if they cancel at least 14 days before the start of the holiday. Any cancellation made within 14 days of your check-in date will not be refunded.</p>

		<p><strong>Do I have to pay a security deposit?</strong><br>
